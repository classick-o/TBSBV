            <p>The Client is responsible for ensuring that the Consultant, during the performance of the Services, is treated like the independent contractor that they are. If the Consultant performing the Services for the Client were to qualify as an employment agreement due to the way the Client and the Consultant work together in practice, The Company is not liable towards the Client for any costs or damages (direct or indirect) as a result of this qualification.</p>
            <p>In case of any change of circumstances under which the Engagement is to be performed which cannot be attributed to the Consultant, the Consultant may make any such amendments to the Engagement as it deems necessary to adhere to the agreed quality standard and specifications. Any costs arising from or related to this change of circumstances will be fully borne by the client.</p>

If requested by the Client, the Consultant shall identify these Subcontractors, specifying in each case their specific expertise.</p>
            <p>The Company expressly state that there is no hierarchy or employment relationship with these subcontractors in any way, directly or indirectly. Just as the Consultant, they are treated like the independent contractors that they are. Therefore, the costs of these subcontractors shall be under the responsibility of The Company, as their relationship is within the scope of the one they have with The Consultant.</p>
